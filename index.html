    <p>Chapter-1 : Computer Fundamentals</p>
    <p>Do you know what are the fundamental elements of a computer?  A computer is an electronic device that accepts the raw data from the user and process it with a set of instructions into information. The following section covers all the Computer Fundamentals in a detailed manner.</p>

    <p>Chapter-2 : System Software</p>
    <p>System Software is a set of programs that control and manage the operations of computer hardware. The system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications. In this article let us learn the types of system software that make the operation of a computer fast and effective.</p>

    <p>Chapter-3 : Application Software</p>
    <p>An Application Software is basically is a program or set of programs that perform a specific task. In addition to this, end-users use this software. Hence, the name end-user programs. In this article, we will learn more about application software.</p>

    <p>Chapter-4 : Internal Storage Encoding of Characters</p>
    <p>We know that a computer understands only binary language (0 and 1). Moreover, it is not able to directly understand or store any alphabets, other numbers, pictures, symbols, etc. Therefore, we use certain coding schemes so that it can understand each of them correctly. Let us understand this in the following chapter called Internal Storage Encoding of Characters.</p>

    <p id="c5">Chapter-5 : Primary Memory</p>
    <p>Primary Memory is the internal memory that stores the data and instructions of the CPU. It is volatile in nature (data is lost when the power is disconnected).  Let us learn more about primary memory in this chapter.</p>

    <p>Chapter-6 : Secondary Memory</p>
    <p>As we know that the primary memory is volatile therefore, we need some devices to store the data permanently so we use some external storage devices for this purpose which we name as the secondary memory. Let us study secondary memory in more detail in the following chapter.</p>

    <p>Chapter-7 : Number Systems</p>
    <p>The number system is a way to represent or express numbers. You have heard of various types of number systems such as the whole numbers and the real numbers. But in the context of computers, we define other types of number systems. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The decimal number system</li>
        <li>The binary number system/li>
        <li>The octal number system and</li>
        <li>The hexadecimal number system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Chapter-8 : Introduction to Python</p>
    <p>Many people call Python developer-friendly because it is quite easy to learn. Python is basically a high-level programming language. It supports both object-oriented programming as well as procedure-oriented programming.  In this chapter let us see the introduction to python in detail.</p>

    <p>Chapter-9 : Programming with Python</p>
    <p>None.</p>

    <p id="c10">Chapter-10 : Programming Methodology</p>
    <p>Programming Methodology is the way of analyzing a particular complex problem by planning the software development and controlling the development process. It helps to plan and structure the code in a more defined way.  The aim of this chapter on computer science is to help you understand the programming methodology in a better way.</p>
